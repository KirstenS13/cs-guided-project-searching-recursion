Searching and Recursion

Recursion
    -- when a function calls itself
    -- 

    -- recursive data structure = data structure that is made up of smaller versions of itself

    --- 3 Core Elements of Recursion ---
        1. needs a base case
            -- base case = the condition where you don't need to recurse anymore
                -- you don't need to run the function again to get the answer
        
        2. changes state to move towards the base case

        3. the function needs to call itself

        See example in demo 0

Recursion is a bit slower than looping because of the stack
    -- each time the function is called, a new context is created, and that context is added to the call stack

    -- even though it is technically slower, the big O notation is the same as looping
        -- because it is still linear (for the example problem)
